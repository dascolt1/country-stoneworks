              Who I am as a man and a mason - I am the third generation of my
              family on my father’s side who is and has been in the construction
              and masonry field. I started working as a mason at the tender age
              of eighteen for my father and later for other companies in the New
              York/Connecticut area. My only tasks were to mix mud for the
              masons, bring them stones, bricks, and blocks and to ensure there
              was always mud for them to lay with. The mud HAD to be the perfect
              texture and consistency, otherwise the longevity of and the
              guarantee on the project would be diminished. Similarly, I always
              watched the masons with admiration and respect, longing to prove
              to them and myself that no matter the task, big or small, I was
              ready to start setting stones with them. Finally after five years
              of not touching a stone, I was given the opportunity to set my
              first stone on the face of a wall. Ever since that day I have
              worked with a passion for the art, history, and culture of being a
              stonemason, as well as being an Italian American from a family who
              came to this country in pursuit of the American Dream. The way
              most Italian immigrants knew how to earn their living was as a
              mason from the Old World in Italy. In this trade, one must be
              dedicated, passionate and hardworking, as it can be grueling at
              times. This is why it’s important for us to love what we do! It's
              not an easy trade, but the end result of a great project coming to
              fruition is what I strive for as a man and a mason!

              I have been doing masonry for over 30 years. I learned from my
